## 01-HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor
#Challenge: Wk 1


##Project Description
#What is this project?
Here is code that was modfied to imporve a very important aspect of web development and that is accessibility. In this instance I was provided starter code that I had to modify. The HTML and CSS starter code did not include appropriate semantics, and would have been confusing to follow at first glance. 

#Files modified
The HTML file provided titled 'index.html' presented the structure of the website. It was messy and I ensured that neatening this file was a top priority. Adding in semantics such as: figures, articles, sections, navs, etc. Furthermore fixing broken links and anything that was missing.

Next was modifying the CSS file to have good semantics like the HTML file. Comments were added and some selectors + classes were moved to their appropriate areas.

#Challenges
A challenge I faced for our first weeks exercise was comprehending the CSS file. I still need practice to properly comprehend the CSS files selectors, as I believe there were some I could have merged but didn't. So, for future, I would need to read more regarding CSS, so I do not return to this problem.
